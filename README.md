This is a simple project for making google-homepage html and css.
I have gained in this project where i was able to acquire css skills for designing atleast a webpage
Html skills have also been gained which included div tag skills and many others.
 I am very grateful for this simple project and curious to learn more and more as i continue with the course because this has been my first ever project of coding in my life.

Thanks
